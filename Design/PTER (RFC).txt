Abstract

   The Post-Trust Ephemeral Relay Protocol (PTER) is a fourth-generation, 
   stateless, memory-only, Layer 4+ messaging protocol designed for 
   environments where persistence is dangerous, trust is obsolete, and 
   metadata is weaponized. Built for red teams, covert ops, and memory-resident 
   tooling, PTER enables encrypted, connection-oriented communication without 
   sessions, sockets, or forensic residue. Unlike legacy protocols, PTER was 
   created outside institutional models—by necessity, not consensus. At its 
   core is Dynamic Ephemeral Transport (DET), a RAM-only, time-bound relay 
   system that forms and dissolves anonymous links with no trace. This document 
   outlines PTER as a tactical framework for volatile, anti-forensic communication 
   in adversarial terrain.

1.  Introduction

   The Post-Trust Ephemeral Relay Protocol (PTER) is a fourth-generation
   Layer 4+ messaging protocol architected for volatility, statelessness,
   and operational stealth. PTER reimagines digital communication for 
   environments where persistence is a liability, trust is obsolete, and 
   traditional networking assumptions are weaponized by adversaries.

   Unlike conventional transport protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, QUIC), PTER
   does not rely on stable sessions, persistent connections, or long-lived 
   endpoints. It eliminates the concept of durable socket-based exchanges 
   in favor of single-shot, RAM-resident packet relays that evaporate 
   upon completion. Messages are never stored on disk and are intentionally 
   ephemeral by design.

   The protocol is intentionally stateless, self-obscuring, and DPI-resistant.
   Its behavior mimics benign traffic patterns or camouflages itself within
   encrypted noise, frustrating deep packet inspection (DPI) and metadata 
   correlation techniques. It operates at the edge of the OSI model, 
   collapsing the assumptions of IP continuity, session identifiers, or 
   symmetric handshakes.

   PTER is intended for use in extreme adversarial environments where 
   forensic resistance, anonymity, and non-persistence are mandatory—
   such as during red team operations, covert relay infrastructures, 
   and memory-only implants.

   This document defines the baseline design and intent of PTER as a 
   conceptual and experimental relay protocol. It does not mandate any 
   particular implementation, but offers a blueprint for volatile, 
   stateless, and trust-agnostic transport mechanisms.

   As part of this blueprint, PTER incorporates a specialized internal 
   mechanism called Dynamic Ephemeral Transport (DET). DET is responsible 
   for orchestrating PTER's volatile relay logic by creating temporary, 
   in-memory links between peers. It is a subcomponent of the PTER protocol 
   stack and enables stateless, non-durable message routing in high-risk environments.

   2.3 Core Relay Mechanism: Introducing Dynamic Ephemeral Transport (DET)
       Through the PTER protocol, we introduce a novel communication paradigm 
       called Dynamic Ephemeral Transport (DET) — a memory-only, stateless, and 
       time-bound relay mechanism designed to operate in zero-trust, volatile environments. 
       DET departs from conventional networking topologies by enabling a cooperative, 
       non-persistent relay mesh that forms dynamically and dissolves autonomously, 
       with no disk state or centralized coordination. DET is purpose-built for scenarios 
       where traditional transport-layer assumptions — such as long-lived sessions, 
       static endpoints, or persistent state — introduce unacceptable security or 
       forensic risk. Instead, DET offers a fluid, ephemeral relay fabric where 
       every node both participates and supports, but never persists. DET is not a 
       standalone protocol but an internal operational construct within the PTER 
       architecture, enabling volatile message relays in high-risk, zero-trust environments.

      2.3.1. Temporal Peer Linking
         When a node (e.g., Node A) joins the PTER network, it becomes a volatile participant 
         in the DET layer. If another node (Node B) joins shortly afterward, the two establish a 
         temporary, symmetric, in-memory relay binding. This interaction is neither session-based 
         nor persistent — it is created, used, and dismantled entirely in volatile memory. This 
         process continues as more nodes arrive, forming a time-sensitive, expanding mesh of 
         peer-to-peer ephemeral relays.
      
      Illustration:

         A <--> B <--> C <--> ... <--> N

         Each node in this chain participates in two-way support with adjacent peers, forming a 
         decentralized ephemeral relay sequence. No node retains knowledge of the global topology, 
         and all linkages are automatically expired after transmission, timeout, or disconnect.

      2.3.2. DET Properties and Guarantees
         The Dynamic Ephemeral Transport layer exhibits the following defining characteristics:

         i.   Volatile Binding: All relay relationships are temporary and RAM-resident only.
         ii.  Stateless Design: No handshakes, session keys, or socket persistence is maintained.
         iii. Temporal Locality: Peers form bindings based on arrival time and operational overlap.
         iv.  Zero Centralization: DET does not rely on static routing, DNS, or any form of global coordination.
         v.   Bilateral Support: Nodes act both as originators and ephemeral relays simultaneously.

      2.3.3. Anonymity, Obfuscation, and Resilience
         DET inherently provides the following privacy and stealth benefits:

         i.   Limited Scope Awareness: Each node is only aware of its immediate neighbors; the full relay path is obscured.
         ii.  No Traceable Artifacts: Because DET never touches disk or persistent memory, forensic recovery is effectively nullified.
         iii. Traffic Camouflage: Relay behavior can be obfuscated using protocol mimicry, randomized packet timing, 
         or encrypted padding to resist DPI and behavioral fingerprinting.

      2.3.4. Mathematical Model for DET
      To analyze the behavior of the Dynamic Ephemeral Transport (DET) mechanism in a formal and simplified manner, 
      we define a deterministic model of temporal support links within the relay mesh.

      Problem Statement

      In the DET layer, nodes join the ephemeral relay network sequentially over time. Upon joining, each node forms 
      mutual (bidirectional) volatile support links with its immediate temporal neighbors. This creates a decentralized 
      chain of in-memory relay relationships that evaporate after use. 
      The goal is to calculate the total number of such support links given a set of N nodes.

      Definitions
      Let:
         N be the total number of nodes currently active in the relay mesh.
         L(N) be the number of mutual (bidirectional) support links established among them.

      Mathematical Model
      The number of relay links in the DET network is given by:

      L(N) = N - 1

      This holds under the assumption that:

         The first node establishes no links (it has no predecessor).
         Each additional node connects to its immediate predecessor upon joining.
         Each connection is symmetric (i.e., relaying is bidirectional).
         No long-term memory or state is preserved between nodes.

         | Number of Nodes (N) | Relay Links (L) |
         | ------------------- | --------------- |
         | 1                   | 0               |
         | 2                   | 1               |
         | 3                   | 2               |
         | 4                   | 3               |
         | 5                   | 4               |

         This results in a volatile linear chain topology of the form:

         A <--> B <--> C <--> D <--> E

         Where <--> represents a volatile, bidirectional support link that exists only in memory 
         and is discarded after message forwarding or timeout.

         Operational Considerations
         Volatility: All links are RAM-resident and auto-terminated after transmission.
         Locality: Each node only knows its immediate neighbors.
         Statelessness: There are no persistent sessions, no routing tables, and no global state.
         This model allows red team operators and stealth network designers to predict the topological 
         footprint of a DET mesh at any given moment based on the number of active participants.

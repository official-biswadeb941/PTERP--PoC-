## 3. 🛠️ Modifications & Forking

Forking, redistribution, and community contributions are welcomed **with conditions**:

* ✅ Codebase may be extended or integrated
* ❌ Core protocol logic, ephemeral intent, and memory-residency principles must **not be altered**
* ❌ Changing or mutating the protocol’s **purpose** breaks license terms

Forks **must include clear labels** like:

```
Based on PTER Protocol – Modified by {YourName/Org}
```

You may not present a fork as “PTER” without attribution or clarity of changes.

---

* ✅ Redistribute source code
* ✅ Distribute compiled binaries or libraries

However, all redistributions **must include**:

* The original license

## 5. ⚖️ No Warranty, No Liability

> “This protocol is smoke in RAM. You run it at your own risk.”

The PTER Protocol is provided **“as-is”**, without warranty or guarantee of any kind.
The author accepts **no responsibility or liability** for:

* System damage
* Legal consequences
* Data loss
* Ethical misuse

---

## 6. 🕵️ Zero Surveillance Clause

The use or inclusion of:

* ❌ Telemetry
* ❌ Logging frameworks
* ❌ Tracking code
* ❌ Backdoors or silent callbacks

...is **strictly prohibited** under this license. Violating this clause results in **immediate and permanent license revocation**.

---

## 7. 💠 Termination Conditions

Your right to use the PTER Protocol is immediately revoked if you:

* ❌ Use it commercially
* ❌ Integrate it into government/military/surveillance systems
* ❌ Strip or hide attribution
* ❌ Modify core protocol principles
* ❌ Add tracking, logging, or telemetry
* ❌ Rebrand a fork without acknowledgement

Once revoked, **you must delete all copies** of the software and cease any usage.

---

## 8. 🧬 Philosophical Clause

> “PTER exists only in memory. To bind it to logs, to permanence, to surveillance — is to kill it.”

Any attempt to anchor PTER to disk, to fingerprints, to surveillance, to log trails — is a violation of its essence, and thus, of this license.

---

## 9. 📜 License Scope

This license applies to:

* The PTER Protocol Specification
* Its reference implementation(s)
* Any original assets, documentation, or tools provided by the author
